# hello-world
what have I started?

I'm learning to code via FCC and it scares me. I'm anxious about the amount of hours it's going to take and the fact that this started as fun for me and now it's starting to turn into a $$ making goal. I enjoy writing and yearn for a place to show my true self without being judged or ridiculed for my thoughts & beliefs. At the time I'm writing this, my husband & I are going through a rough patch & I'm not sure where we'll end up or if we'll come out of it. I hope I'm not using this as a way to isolate myself & hide.
